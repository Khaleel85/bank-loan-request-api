One way to add the permissions from a group model to a user is to use the Group and Permission
 models from django.contrib.auth.models. You can create a group with a name and assign it some
 permissions using the permissions field, which is a many-to-many relation. Then you can add a
 user to the group using the groups field of the user model, which is also a many-to-many relation.
 For example, you can do something like this:

from django.contrib.auth.models import User, Group, Permission
from django.contrib.contenttypes.models import ContentType

# Create a content type for your model
content_type = ContentType.objects.get(app_label='myapp', model='MyModel')

# Create a permission for your model
permission = Permission.objects.create(codename='can_do_something', name='Can do something', content_type=content_type)

# Create a group and assign it the permission
group = Group.objects.create(name='MyGroup')
group.permissions.add(permission)

# Get a user and add it to the group
user = User.objects.get(username='myuser')
user.groups.add(group)
Copy
This way, the user will have the permission from the group model. You can check if the user has
a permission using the has_perm method of the user model. For example:

user.has_perm('myapp.can_do_something') # True
Copy
I hope this helps you understand how to add the permissions from a group model to a user. ðŸ˜Š
